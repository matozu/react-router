<p>This is the project on which I practiced working with react router.</p>
<p>I followed this tutorial: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial</p>
<p>Deployed at: https://matozu.github.io/react-router/</p>
<p>Currently the data is saved in local storage but i'm working on a backend that will save it in database.</p>
